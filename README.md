DHBWKA-KnowledgeBasedSystems
============================

This repository assembles different programming projects in the domain of machine learning and knowledge-based systems I have students doing in the laboratory at *Duale Hochschule* in Karlsruhe, where I have been teaching some courses.

As the main goal is for the students to be programming and thinking about the problems, not so much that they finally hand in a perfect solution, it seems not to be prohibitive to keep my solutions in a public repository.
